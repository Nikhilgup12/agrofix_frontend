### Data Flow
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend API
2. Backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses
3. Frontend updates the UI based on the responses

## üîí Security Features

- JWT-based authentication for admin access
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend
- Sanitized inputs to prevent injection attacks
- CORS configuration to control API access
- HTTPS for secure data transmission
